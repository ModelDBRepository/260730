  This xpp code was contributed by Artie Sherman.

  The model is defined in ML.ode The version with a SNIC, corresponding
 to Fig. 11 in the paper (Sherman & Ha 2017). is defined in
 ML_SNIC.set. The version with a Hopf bifurcation, corresponding to
 Fig. 12, is defined in ML_Hopf.set
  <p/>
  A default run of the model with commands like<p/>
  <pre>
    xppaut ML.ode
    </pre>
  and then in the GUI clicking Initalconds -> Go
  should display a figure like:<p/>
